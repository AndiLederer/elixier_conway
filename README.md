# Description
"Conway's Game of Life" is not exactly an usefule project. It's only purpose is to show me how elixir and Erlang is dealing with state.

## Application start
Due to display problems on my windows pc, I set back the application start and restart the output with an HTML-Output page. For this purpose I wrap the output into an json-string an display it in an simple HTML-Site. 

##Roadmap
Creating an gen_txp server witch response a new state for every call.
The HTML-Site has to take care of the refresh rate.

##Elixir Version
This version was build and tested with elixir-lang_v1.0.0.
Runs with mix test
